# z00m is not zoom

* v0.0.2 - you can connect to another person! lots of bugs though.
* v0.0.1 - selfie video view works!

## TODO

- Backend message bus that does not require turn-by-turn communication.
- Get a proper cert from LetsEncrypt and upgrade Ubuntu
- Rewrite properly with async and await and none of this horrible hacky v0.0.2 kruft
- Room-based so that you can send a link to anyone. 
- Multi-person
- TURN server for those tricky situations
